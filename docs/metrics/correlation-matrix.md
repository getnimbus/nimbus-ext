# Correlation measures how closely two assets move together over time.

A correlation of ðŸŸ© 1 means that two assets move perfectly in sync, while a correlation of ðŸŸ¥ -1 means that they move in opposite directions. A correlation of 0 means that there is no relationship between the movements of the two assets.

The goal of correlation diversification is to select assets that have low or negative correlations with each other, so that they can offset each other's losses and smooth out the portfolio's returns. For example, if you have a portfolio of stocks and bonds, you may want to add some commodities or alternative investments that tend to perform well when stocks and bonds are struggling.

There are several benefits of correlation diversification:

- It can reduce the volatility and drawdowns of your portfolio, which can improve your risk-adjusted returns and help you preserve your capital.
- It can enhance your portfolio's performance by capturing the upside potential of different asset classes and strategies.
- It can increase your portfolio's resilience and adaptability to changing market conditions and scenarios.

Correlation diversification is not a silver bullet, but it can be a powerful tool to protect your portfolio from market shocks and enhance your long-term returns. By combining assets that have different risk-return profiles and behaviors, you can create a more balanced and robust portfolio that can withstand various market environments.
